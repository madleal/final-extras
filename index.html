<p>Hello! My name is Madel Leal and I am a product of Mexican immigrant parents that came to the United States for the "American Dream."  My passion for traveling emerged the first time I hopped on a plane and went to New York City, circa 2010.  Since then I've been traveling to different places and collect tattoos that hold some significance.  Now, with hopes and dreams to continue to explore this vast beautifil world we live in I try to collect a tattoo to forever commorate and imortalize each memory these places hold for me. I invite you all to explore the many stories and tattoo collection.</p>

<p>Currently, I am in school pursuing a second masters degree at <a href = "https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan's School of Information</a>.  In the Spring of 2010 I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles with a Bachelor's of Arts in Sociology.  I began working in the nonprofit field for five years until deciding it was time to return to school. I consider myself an agent of social change and in the fall of 2016 I began my journey to pursue a Masters degree of Social Work. In April 2018 I recieved my Masters of Social Work.  My academics ventures are just some of my accomplishments.  I take pride in the privilege I have to travel to many different places.</p>

<p>I hope that you all enjoy just some of my personal narratives and snippets of my tattoo collection.  I hope that in reading about my many traveling adventures and tattoos I've collected over the past several years, you too are englighened and inspired to venture out to new horizons.  Happy traveling!</p>
